## Deep Learning Model Samples

We provide information about representative deep learning models.  
The following models are introduced as part of the CNN architecture lineage:

- **LeNet**
- **AlexNet**
- **VGGNet**
- **GoogLeNet**
- **ResNet**
- **MobileNet**
- **EfficientNet**

On GitHub, you can find each model’s dataflow graph and architectural information.
